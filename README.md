# iplantit
- This is the working title of our project. It is on the pathway to become a simple progressive web application that make food garden planning fun and easy!
- These first rounds of development are for the <a href="https://callforcode-platform.bemyapp.com">Call for Code<a> hackathon
- Looking for team-members

## The issue
**Reduce Gloabal food insecurity** 
- One great way to get food that is nutritious, delicious sustainable and good for the environment is to grow it yourself! Even many seasoned gardeners struggle to plan and plot their garden beds.
- What grows well in your area? What grows well together? Where and when do I plant things? 
- The questions go on...


## The solution (about 10 words)
- A simple graphical vector-based application that makes sustainable food gardening and planning fun and easy. It will generate potential garden bed plots that are easy to understand.

- The long term goal is to create community, more features and expand the product to help as many people as possible!

## How it works (up to 5 steps)
1. user enters size and shape of their garden beds
2.
3.
4.
5.



## Solution Roadmap (needs work)
1. Building a Minimum Viable Product
    - really basic data set
    - proof of concept

2. Users can login and save gardens and beds

3. 
- integrate more and more data
- add features
- build community

4. Expand regions
5. Expand garden types


## Team
- Phil Daum

### We need
- someone to build a relational database that can be used for the seed data
- front end developer who can take the draft
- a back end person to link everything togethor
- figure out how to link up some APIs
- who can develop a vector based thing?
