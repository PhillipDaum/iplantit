# iplantit
- This is the working title of our project. It is on the pathway to become a simple progressive web application that make food garden planning fun and easy!
- These first rounds of development are for the <a href="https://callforcode-platform.bemyapp.com">Call for Code<a> hackathon
- Looking for team-members

## The issue
**Reduce Gloabal food insecurity** 
- Empowering people who grow food plants or want to grow food plants
- it is a lot of complex information to process to do this well
- Getting started is difficult for a lot of people
- There is a lack of easily accesible information
- Also, some people don't know what they need to know
- on top of that the process of figuring out where, when and how to plant things within your garden can be daunting 
- it is healthier than a lot of available foods
- its sustainable
- it reduces the impact on food infrastucure (ie victory gardens)
- it could even be done in food deserts!
- it also draws attention to these healthy and sustainable practices


## The solution (about 10 words)
A simple graphical vector-based application that makes sustainable food gardening and planning easy and accesable.

## How it works (up to 5 steps)
1. user enters size and shape of their garden beds
2.
3.
4.
5.



## Solution Roadmap (needs work)
1. Building a Minimum Viable Product
    - really basic data set
    - proof of concept

2. Users can login and save gardens and beds

3. 
- integrate more and more data
- add features
- build community

4. Expand regions
5. Expand garden types


## Team
- Phil Daum

### We need
- someone to build a relational database that can be used for the seed data
- front end developer who can take the draft
- a back end person to link everything togethor
- figure out how to link up some APIs
- who can develop a vector based thing?
