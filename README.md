# iplantit
- This is the working title of our project. It is on the pathway to become a simple progressive web application that make food garden planning fun and easy!
- These first rounds of development are for the <a href="https://callforcode-platform.bemyapp.com">Call for Code<a> hackathon
- Looking for team-members! some of the things we need:
    - Relational Databse Skills
    - API integrations skills
    - Front-end development 

## The issue
**Reduce Gloabal food insecurity** 
- One great way to get food that is nutritious, delicious sustainable and good for the environment is to grow it yourself! Even many seasoned gardeners struggle to plan and plot their garden beds.
- What grows well in your area? What grows well together? Where and when do I plant things? 
- The questions go on...


## The solution (about 10 words)
- A simple graphical vector-based application that makes sustainable food gardening and planning fun and easy. It will generate potential garden bed plots that are easy to understand.

- The long term goal is to create community, more features and expand the product to help as many people as possible!

## How it works (up to 5 steps)
1. User enters the size and shape of their garden bed plot
2. Algorithms match potential plants
3. Users see several computer generated potential garden bed plots 
4. Later, we can add more features and a larger database
5. Then we can help lots of people grow food!


## Solution Roadmap (needs work)
1. Building a Minimum Viable Product

-- USDA Web Soil Survey: https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm
- Weather
    - tools from hackathon
    -- Weather Company API (costs money I think just after December 1, 2022)
- Indexes of Seed information
    -- Look at google docs for now
