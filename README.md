- There are all kinds of tools, websites, apps and books that can help people plan and maintain a garden.
- ours is different becuase it offers suggestions

## The issue
**Reduce Gloabal food insecurity** 
- One great way to get food that is nutritious, delicious sustainable and good for the environment is to grow it yourself! Even many seasoned gardeners struggle to plan and plot their garden beds.
- What grows well in your area? What grows well together? Where and when do I plant things? 
- The questions go on...

## The solution
- A simple application that makes sustainable food gardening and planning fun, easy and accesiable. It will generate potential garden bed plots that are easy to understand.
- The long term goal is to create community, more features and expand the product to help as many people as possible!

## How it works
1. User enters the size of the garden bed they want to grow in and their zip code
2. Our algorithms match potential plants that could work well together in the user's garden bed and geographical location
3. Users can see several of suggestions 
4. Users can connect with other gardeners in their local community, or anywhere.
